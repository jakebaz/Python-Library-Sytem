Instructions for running the program

5 instances for each the users and books classes have already been created 
and stored using the BookList and UserList classes. An instance of the loans
class has also been created with 4 books borrowed by some of the users. All
you will need to do to run the program is call whichever functions you want 
to test and run the program. All of this is in a function called 'system_test' 
at the bottom of the page.

Please note that all instances storing user information is not actual information
about a person and is just made up for the purpose of testing this system.
